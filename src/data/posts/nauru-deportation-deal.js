    content: `The Australian government has recently passed new legislation allowing the expedited deportation of certain non-citizens to Nauru.  

Under this 30-year agreement, Australia will provide Nauru with approximately A$2.5 billion, including upfront and annual payments, to support resettlement and processing of deportees.

The new Nauru resettlement program applies to people whose visas Australia has cancelled due to prison terms or character-related refusals, and who cannot be sent back to countries such as Iran, Myanmar, or Iraq because they would face persecution there. 

A key feature of the legislation is that it removes the obligation to grant procedural fairness at the final stage of removal, while maintaining procedural fairness during visa refusals or cancellations.

Implementation of the deal is expected to begin soon, though legal challenges and international scrutiny may influence how it proceeds.  

This policy shift represents a significant development in Australia's approach to immigration and offshore detention.`,

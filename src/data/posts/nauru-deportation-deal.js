The Australian government has recently passed new legislation allowing the expedited deportation of certain non-citizens to Nauru.  
Under this 30-year agreement, Australia will provide Nauru with approximately A$2.5 billion, including upfront and annual payments, to support resettlement and processing of deportees.

The law removes some procedural fairness requirements and limits court appeals, enabling faster transfers of those denied visas due to criminal convictions or other grounds.  
Human rights groups have raised concerns about potential risks to deportees, including limited access to services and safety conditions in Nauru.

Implementation of the deal is expected to begin soon, though legal challenges and international scrutiny may influence how it proceeds.  
This policy shift represents a significant development in Australia's approach to immigration and offshore detention.

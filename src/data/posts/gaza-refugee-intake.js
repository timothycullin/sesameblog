In 2025, Australia has updated its refugee intake from Gaza in response to ongoing humanitarian crises.

The government is prioritizing families and children affected by conflict, providing temporary housing, health assessments, language programs, and community support for resettlement.

Humanitarian organizations have welcomed the move, though challenges remain in accommodating all applicants promptly.

This update reflects Australia's continued commitment to international humanitarian obligations and support for displaced populations.
